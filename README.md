# Matrix-Calculator
A C++ program to calculate n x n matrix operations.

Can calculate - Transpose, Determinate, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

#Utilizes a singly linked list data structure and recursive algorithms

Program takes 3 or 4 arguments via command line:
Addition: add a.txt b.txt output.txt
(a.txt and b.txt both being text files with seperate matrices,
and output.txt being the filename of the output file)
Subtraction: sub a.txt b.txt ouput.txt
Multiplication: mul a.txt b.txt output.txt
Transpose: tra a.txt output.txt
Determinant: det a.txt output.txt
